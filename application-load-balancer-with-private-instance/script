In this project we deployed a web server in private instance using application load balancer

We created three instaces in different AZ with 1 public and 2 private instances.
Public instance is used to access private instace as bastion host.

In two private instance we install apache server
```sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd```
